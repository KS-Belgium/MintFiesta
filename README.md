# MintyFiesta
The project is a dApp that allows event organizers and their sponsors to reward and boost participant enthusiasm with exclusive NFTs.

## Integration with Rootstock and Zircuit
Our contracts are available on the Rootstock and Zircuit testnets. We have successfully deployed smart contracts on both testnets and verified them via Zircuit Explorer.

## Team and Backgrounds
Our team consists of three members, all undergraduate students in computer science at the Haute École en Hainaut and members of Kryptosphère Belgium. We began our journey with web3 hackathons at ETH London.
