### Setting Up Firebase Realtime Database

If you do not have a Firebase Realtime Database set up yet, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Realtime Database on Firebase:**
   - Go to Firebase and create a new Realtime Database.

2. **Import JSON File:**
   - Import the JSON file located at `react-app/public/MintyFiesta_database_export.json` into your newly created Firebase Realtime Database.

3. **Configure Project Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Project Overview" and then to "Project Settings" in Firebase.
   - Under the "General" tab, scroll down to your apps and copy the `firebaseConfig` object:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
         apiKey: "",
         authDomain: "",
         databaseURL: "",
         projectId: "",
         storageBucket: "",
         messagingSenderId: "",
         appId: "",
         measurementId: ""
     };
     ```
   - Replace the current `firebaseConfig` in the file `react-app/src/model/firebase_api.json` with this copied configuration.
